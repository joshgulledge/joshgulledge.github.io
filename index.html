 <h4>Q3 Contracting</h4> 
 2017 - 2020 <lb> I started at this company as a general labor. I was responsible in helping the rest of the crew run smoothly. 
I shoveled around underground utilities to visually spot them so the backhoe operator could safely dig around them. 
After a year I moved up to pipe fusion. In this position I was responsible for joining plastic pipe material together 
in a way that met natural gas safety standards. I work with live natural gas pipes in order to transfer gas to 
new mains and services that we install underground.
