 <h4>Q3 Contracting</h4> 
 <h6>2017 - 2020</h6>
  I started at this company as a general labor. I was responsible in helping the rest of the crew run smoothly. 
  I shoveled around underground utilities to visually spot them so the backhoe operator could safely dig around them. 
  After a year I moved up to pipe fusion. In this position I was responsible for joining plastic pipe material together 
  in a way that met natural gas safety standards. I work with live natural gas pipes in order to transfer gas to 
  new mains and services that we install underground.

  I was the owner of this small contracting company. I handled residential remodeling contracts that were purchased 
  from Lowes corporation stores. I tore out and installed doors, windows, and cabinets. I had to schedule and perform the 
  jobs in a timely manner and productive manner as well as invoice upon completion.
