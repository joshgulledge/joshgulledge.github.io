  <h4> Objective </h4>
   My professional goal is to begin a long-term career in software engineering and development. I believe that I have skills and attributes that 
   would make me a great fit for this field. My past work has included building projects from the ground up, utilizing skills such quantitive reasoning 
   and paying attention to the smallest details. Also, I have started learning to code on my own, and have constructed a few projects with what I 
   have learned. An example of one of these projects was a pocket pet game that I made with Swift. In this project I advanced my understanding of for loops,
   while loops, and creating and altering classes and functions. Ultimately my past work, recently gained knowledge, abilities, and convictions will 
   make me a great fit for a career in software.
