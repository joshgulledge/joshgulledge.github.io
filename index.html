 <h4> Objective </h4>
 
  I am hoping that this resume will help make it abundantly evident that I will be an excellent fit into the prime student body. I 
 am very dedicated to my work and want to make everything I do spetacular. I love learning and this field is one where I can 
 always learn. As is apparent in my work history i have been in the construction field for most of my life, I believe this has 
 given me the skill to know how to build something in stages from the ground up. When building software and code you also need to 
 be able to visualize and build something from the ground up. I have recently started studying languages on my own time and I often
 get lost in them, enjoying every aspect of it. This is something that I will not fail at because I refuse to fail. Thank you for 
 your time and I hope to begin the coding adventure with you soon.

  <h4>Q3 Contracting</h4> 
 
  <h6>2017 - 2020</h6>
 
   I started at this company as a general labor. I was responsible in helping the rest of the crew run smoothly. 
  I shoveled around underground utilities to visually spot them so the backhoe operator could safely dig around them. 
  After a year I moved up to pipe fusion. In this position I was responsible for joining plastic pipe material together 
  in a way that met natural gas safety standards. I work with live natural gas pipes in order to transfer gas to 
  new mains and services that we install underground.
